# 💫 About Me:
I’m a Cybersecurity student and Junior Penetration Tester specializing in network and web application security. I have strong hands-on experience in ethical hacking, red teaming, and vulnerability assessment through real-world labs and CTF platforms like TryHackMe, Hack The Box, and PortSwigger.<br><br>I’ve trained extensively in penetration testing methodologies inspired by eJPT, OSCP, and EWAPT, and I’m comfortable working across Linux and Windows environments. My toolset includes Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, Nessus, Acunetix, and custom scripts written in Python and Bash.<br><br>I’m passionate about breaking systems to make them more secure, continuously improving my skills through labs, competitions, and research. I enjoy learning how attacks work—from Active Directory exploitation to web vulnerabilities and malware concepts—and translating that knowledge into practical defense strategies.<br><br>🔐 Interests:<br>- Penetration Testing & Red Teaming  <br>- Web Application Security  <br>- Active Directory Attacks & Defense  <br>- CTFs & Security Research  <br>- Network & Cloud Security  <br><br>📫 Reach me:<br>- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mostafa-waleed99  <br>- Email: mostafa23110006@gmail.com
